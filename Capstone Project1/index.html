    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>As a Flight Control Software Engineer at Turkish Aerospace, I apply my programming skills and computer science knowledge to develop innovative solutions for the defense industry. I work with multidisciplinary teams to design, implement, and test software features that enhance the performance and functionality of cutting-edge aerospace technologies.

        I graduated from Hacettepe University with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering, where I gained a solid foundation in algorithmic problem-solving, data structures, and software engineering. I also participated in a multimodal research project that involved matching and enriching DIY videos, where I learned to use Python and other tools to process and analyze multimedia data. 
        
        I am passionate about competitive programming and algorithmic challenges, and I enjoy sharing my knowledge and insights with others. I run a YouTube channel where I solve and explain coding problems from platforms like LeetCode, and I also attended a development workshop organized by ACM Hacettepe. I am always eager to learn new skills and explore new domains, and I aspire to create elegant and efficient software solutions that make a positive impact in the world.
